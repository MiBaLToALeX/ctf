- Unicef has staff in the country in several locations and is helping to provide families with access to clean water and food, as well as psychosocial support for traumatised children, recreation kits and learning kits. “Needs are wide, ranging from hygiene products to blankets, gas burners and first aid kits,” Afshan Khan, the Unicef regional director for Europe and central Asia, says. In recent days, the charity said heavy weapons fire along the contact line in eastern Ukraine had damaged water infrastructure and schools.

It estimates there are up to 7.5 million children in need of support and says a £46 donation will provide a family with an emergency water and hygiene kit. Donations can be made online or over the phone: 0300 330 5699.
